REACT_PORTFOLIO | VER. 0.1.0

My primary portfolio to be used with my resume and deployed to github pages.


                                    TODO: 

* CONTACT SECTION.
     This will (*should*) be simple, bump to near-front 

* Top-bar
    Currently ('23-06-22) this has been hollowed out and removed from the 
    page due to issues. After the contact section is built, or at least the 
    front-end elments are built out, this should be resolved.

* LANDING SECTION. 
    Current is primative but functional. Needs polish.

* FOOTER
    >make

* WORK HISTORY
    ?


* (Misc.)
    * Scroll to top button?




                            WORKLOG/COMPLETED:
