REACT_PORTFOLIO | VER. 0.1.0

My primary portfolio to be used with my resume and deployed to github pages.


                                    TODO: 

* FIX: burger button. Micro-sprint at least get the static to render, state 
    and functionality to be added later. 

* CARD PROP:
    Going to have multiple skills and lang. listed, might as well build 
    up a template for re-useability. 

* CONTACT SECTION.
     This will be simple, low priority

* LANDING SECTION. 
    Semi priority. First thing seen on landing, got to look good. Mulling over 
    some form of animation and/or dynamic background. Need a good balance between
    appealing without being too flashy or over the top, tasteful.








                            WORKLOG/COMPLETED:

* TBD
