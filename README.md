REACT_PORTFOLIO | VER. 0.1.0 | *IN PROGRESS*

My primary portfolio to be used with my resume and deployed to github pages.


                                    TODO: 

* CONTACT SECTION.
   > This will (*should*) be simple, bump to near-front 

* Top-bar
   > Currently ('23-06-22) this has been hollowed out and removed from the 
   > page due to issues. After the contact section is built, or at least the 
   > front-end elments are built out, this should be resolved.

* FOOTER

* WORK HISTORY
   > ?
